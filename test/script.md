  Introduction

    •  Hi everyone, welcome to my YouTube channel! In this video, I'm going to share with you how I started dominating LeetCode, one of the
       most popular platforms for technical interview preparation.

    •  But here's the twist: I did it with the help of an AI language model called ChatGPT. Yes, that's right, I'm going to show you how you
       can leverage the power of AI to improve your LeetCode skills and achieve your dream job!

  What is ChatGPT?

    •  First things first, what exactly is ChatGPT? ChatGPT is a type of AI language model developed by OpenAI, one of the world's leading
       AI research organizations. It's based on a neural network architecture that can analyze natural language and generate human-like
       responses to text-based inputs.

    •  In other words, ChatGPT can "understand" what you're asking for and provide you with relevant information or advice in natural
       language. And that's exactly what makes it so useful for LeetCode!

  How I used ChatGPT for LeetCode

    •  So now you might be wondering, how exactly did I use ChatGPT to dominate LeetCode? Well, it's actually pretty simple. Whenever I got
       stuck on a LeetCode problem, I would just ask ChatGPT for help!

    •  For example, I would type in the problem statement or a specific question I had, and ChatGPT would generate a response with relevant
       information, tips, or even pseudocode for solving the problem. It was like having a personal LeetCode coach at my disposal 24/7!

  Examples of ChatGPT in action

    •  Let me give you some examples of how exactly I leveraged ChatGPT for LeetCode. Suppose I was stuck on a tricky dynamic programming
       problem. I could simply type in "how to approach dynamic programming" or "tips for optimizing dynamic programming solutions" and
       ChatGPT would provide me with a comprehensive response covering all the key concepts and techniques.

    •  Or if I had a specific question about a problem, I could simply ask "how to implement memoization for Fibonacci recursion" or "what's
       the time complexity of this algorithm" and ChatGPT would give me a quick and accurate answer.

    •  And the best part is, ChatGPT is constantly learning and improving based on the data it receives, so the more you use it, the smarter
       and more helpful it becomes!

  Conclusion

    •  So there you have it, folks, that's how I started dominating LeetCode with the help of ChatGPT. If you're serious about improving
       your technical interview skills and landing your dream job, I highly recommend giving ChatGPT a try. Who knows, it might just give
       you the AI-powered edge you need to succeed!
